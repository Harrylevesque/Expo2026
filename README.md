## welcome to my science fair project diarey
    this year, after a great sucess for my first year at a science fair, i will be making sonething very interesting
    i am planning to make a log in systemment for security and ease of use
    the concept is that there is no passwords

### the plan
    create a system for loging in using a simple qr code scan
    i will need to
        create a secure envierment on my vps
        create a dynamic session storer ( not a db storing cookies)
        create a generation software for making the wr codes the end user will use to log in
        find a way to keep it rotating all of the time with different data
        create a mobile inteeface for scanning the special qr code
        make the phone do some authing and cracking based on info about the device and what it scanned on the qr code
        create a heartbeat system for enshuring no device swapping man in the middle ect
        create the responce mechsnism
        find a way to stay logged in and continussly ensure no changes in the device, none of the stuff could be live session hacked
        a bunch more things
